              <h3> Who am I ?</h3>
               <p> I am Lison Berekbaum, 18yrs old and currently living in Lille while studying at IESEG School of Management. I am from Senlis (60). Alongside my studies in business, I am driven by two passions quite one the contrary : Formula 1 and space! I am a active woman, I run 10km each week and maybe 20km this week-end 🏃‍♀️ I aspired to manage a 5 stars hotel after IESEG. </p>

            <div class="box-white" id="formula">
               <h3> Formula 1  🏎 💨 </h3>
               <p> For a few years I have been following Formula 1 closely, thanks to the Netflix series <cite>Drive to Survive</cite> which is absolutely incredible. This mechanical sport is so different from the others that it fascinates with its logistics and all its complexity. I hope one day to have the opportunity to watch a Grand Prix in France, if possible at Paul Ricard, one of the most beautiful circuits in the world if not the most beautiful with its blue and red stripes.

               Here is my ranking of my three favorite squirrels with one each time my heart pilot</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li> <cite>McLaren🧡</cite> with Daniel Ricardo (rip Noris)</li>
                     <li> <cite>RedBull</cite> and the master Max Verstappen🟧🟦</li>
                     <li> <cite>Alpine 🇫🇷</cite> with Esteban Ocon</li></ul>
            </div>

            <div class="box-white" id="space">
               <h3> Space 🛰🪐</h3>
               <p>I am also passionate about space and everything directly or indirectly related to aerospace. To say that it's just overhead and that we still have so much to discover is simply fascinating, but it's also terrifying because it's the total unknown. I find that space is a poetic place full of resources and which I am sure will be very useful to us in the years to come…</p>
